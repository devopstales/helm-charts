Thank you for installing {{ .Chart.Name }}.

Your release is named {{ .Release.Name }}.

To learn more about the release, try:

  $ helm status {{ .Release.Name }}
  $ helm get all {{ .Release.Name }}

To activate the Admission Controller you need to label the namespace:

  $ kubectl label namespace default trivy-image-validator=enabled

If you deployd {{ .Chart.Name }} with createSelfSignedCert: true test the ValidatingWebhookConfiguration:

  $ kubectl get ValidatingWebhookConfiguration trivy-image-validating-webhook-cfg -o yaml | grep caBundle

WARNING:
The trivy-image-validating-webhook-cfg ValidatingWebhookConfiguration object not tracked or managed as part of the release!!!
Once Tiller verifies that the hook has reached its ready state, it will leave the hook resource alone.
This means that you cannot rely upon helm delete to remove the resources. To destroy such resources, you need to destroy manually:

  $ kubectl delete ValidatingWebhookConfiguration trivy-image-validating-webhook-cfg
